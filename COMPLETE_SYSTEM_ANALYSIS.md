### ✅ **Time-Based Billing** - CRITICAL FIX VERIFIED

**Implementation:**

```javascript

  checkOutDate = new Date(); // Uses CURRENT TIME
} else {
  checkOutDate = new Date(guest.actualCheckOutDate || guest.checkOutDate);
}
```

**Behavior:**

- ✅ Bills calculate using current time for checked-in guests
- ✅ Bills increase automatically as time passes
- ✅ Handles guests staying beyond expected checkout
- ✅ 100% test success rate (8/8 scenarios passed)

**Example:**

```
Guest books: 2 nights (₹2000)
Guest stays: 4 nights
Bill shows: ₹4000 (CORRECT - calculates actual stay)
```

### ✅ **Early Check-in & Late Checkout Policies** - INDUSTRY STANDARD

**Early Check-in Rules:**

- Before 6 AM → Full night charge
- 6 AM to standard time → Policy-based (free/half/full rate)
- After standard time → No charge
