## üìä COMPREHENSIVE TEST COVERAGE

### Test 1: Standard Checked-In Guest ‚úÖ

**Scenario:** Guest checked in, staying within expected dates  
**Result:** PASSED

- Correctly calculates billing until current time (not just expected checkout)
- Applies late checkout charges dynamically as time passes
- Marks as "ongoing stay"

**Scenario:** Guest booked 2 nights but has stayed 5+ nights without extending  
**Result:** PASSED

- **CRITICAL FIX VERIFIED:** System now calculates actual stay duration
- Bill increases automatically from 2 nights (‚Çπ2000) to 6 nights (‚Çπ6000)
- This was the main bug - now working perfectly!

### Test 3: Early Check-in (8 AM - Half Rate Policy) ‚úÖ

**Scenario:** Guest checks in at 8 AM (standard is 2 PM)  
**Result:** PASSED

- Correctly applies ‚Çπ500 early check-in charge (half of room rate)
- Policy-based calculation working correctly

### Test 4: Very Early Check-in (3 AM - Full Night) ‚úÖ

**Scenario:** Guest checks in at 3 AM (before 6 AM threshold)  
**Result:** PASSED

- Correctly applies full ‚Çπ1000 charge for check-in before 6 AM
- Previous night charge logic working

### Test 5: Late Checkout (3 PM - Half Rate Policy) ‚úÖ

**Scenario:** Guest checks out at 3 PM (standard is 11 AM)  
**Result:** PASSED

- Correctly applies ‚Çπ500 late checkout charge
- Policy-based calculation accurate

### Test 6: Very Late Checkout (8 PM - Full Night) ‚úÖ

**Scenario:** Guest checks out at 8 PM (after 6 PM threshold)  
**Result:** PASSED

- Correctly applies full ‚Çπ1000 charge for checkout after 6 PM
- Additional night charge working

### Test 7: Checked-Out Guest (Historical Billing) ‚úÖ

**Scenario:** Guest already checked out - historical billing  
**Result:** PASSED

- Uses actual checkout date, NOT current time
- Bill remains frozen at checkout amount
- No unwanted automatic increases

### Test 8: Combined Early Check-in + Late Checkout ‚úÖ

**Scenario:** Guest checks in early (8 AM) and leaves late (4 PM)  
**Result:** PASSED

- Correctly applies BOTH charges: ‚Çπ500 + ‚Çπ500
- Total calculation accurate: Base (‚Çπ3000) + Early (‚Çπ500) + Late (‚Çπ500) = ‚Çπ4000

## üîß CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Time-Based Billing for Ongoing Stays** üéØ

**Problem:** Bills calculated using expected checkout date, not actual stay duration  
**Solution:** Modified `automaticBillingService.js` to use current time for checked-in guests  
**Impact:** Bills now increase automatically as time passes

**Code Change:**

```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
const checkOutDate = new Date(guest.checkOutDate); // Always used expected date

// AFTER (FIXED):
if (guest.status === "checked_in" && !guest.actualCheckOutDate) {
  checkOutDate = new Date(); // Use current time for ongoing stays
} else {
  checkOutDate = new Date(guest.actualCheckOutDate || guest.checkOutDate);
}
```

### 2. **Actual Check-in Date Tracking**

**Added:** `actualCheckInDate` field to Guest model  
**Benefit:** System now tracks both expected and actual check-in times  
**Usage:** Uses actual time for billing calculations, expected time for booking reference

### 3. **Stay Extension Functionality**

**Added:** New endpoint `PUT /api/guests/:id/extend-stay`  
**Features:**

- Updates expected checkout date
- Recalculates billing automatically
- Maintains audit trail with notes

### 4. **Background Billing Service Verification**

**Status:** Running correctly ‚úÖ  
**Frequency:** Every hour  
**Function:** Automatically recalculates bills for all checked-in guests across all hotels  
**Result:** Ensures bills stay up-to-date without manual intervention

## üìà SYSTEM BEHAVIOR EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Extended Stay Scenario

```
Guest books: Oct 1-3 (2 nights) = Expected ‚Çπ2000
Guest stays: Oct 1-6 (5 nights) = Actual ‚Çπ5000

‚úÖ System correctly bills ‚Çπ5000 (not ‚Çπ2000)
‚úÖ Bill updates automatically every hour
‚úÖ No manual recalculation needed
```

### Example 2: Early Check-in + Extended Stay

```
Guest books: Oct 1 (2 PM) - Oct 3 (11 AM)
Guest arrives: Oct 1 (8 AM) - Early check-in
Guest leaves: Oct 5 (11 AM) - Extended 2 extra nights

Charges:
- Base: 4 nights √ó ‚Çπ1000 = ‚Çπ4000
- Early check-in: ‚Çπ500 (half rate policy)
Total: ‚Çπ4500

‚úÖ All charges calculated automatically
‚úÖ Background service tracks extended stay
‚úÖ Bill increases from ‚Çπ2500 to ‚Çπ4500
```
